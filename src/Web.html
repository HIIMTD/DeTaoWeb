		<h1>Personal Information</h1>
		<p>I am a sunny and optimistic guy who just graduated from Carleton University, bachelor of computer science, served as a teaching assistant in the course "Abstract Data Types/Algorithms". After graduation, I started to have an interest in the network and keep self-learning to improve myself. I'd like to apply for a job in the field of networking and software development.</p>
